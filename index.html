    <p class="project-desc">Transit Buddy is a project I worked on in a group for Macalester's software development course. It is designed to offer the user an instant view of the positions of transit (buses/trains) nearby, focused on the Twin Cities metro area. The project is built using the Flutter multiplatform framework, and as such supports both iOS and Android with identical builds. The project code is written in Dart, which we had to learn on the fly for the project's deadline 3 months later. The app communicates with a GTFS realtime feed delivered as a protocol buffer supplied by Metro Transit. The information here is processed in our app and converted into visual elements such as bus location markers and route path highlights, and updates its information in realtime.</p>
